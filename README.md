# Level up with Nix challenges

Nix is a refreshing look on what the future of package management
could look like.  Declarative, deterministic, purely functional, able
to handle packages of different versions and build systems of all
kinds.  The documentation is also very good, there's resources such as
[Nix Pills](https://nixos.org/nixos/nix-pills/) and the [Nixpkgs
manual](https://nixos.org/nixpkgs/manual/).  However, to get from
reading those resources to building real-world projects can seem
daunting.  If only there was a way to practice your building skills.

Here I propose just that, a set of Nix challenges to help you get
familiar with building things.  Starting from a basic C project,
you'll get acquainted with transforming build scripts from non-Nix
platforms using a variety of tools at your disposal (`patchSheBangs`,
etc.).  Solutions will be provided, so if you get stuck you'll be able
to see how it works.

## The Levels
- Level 0: Hello world C program
- Level 1: GNU Hello
- Level 2: GNU Ed
- Level ???: [TilEm](http://lpg.ticalc.org/prj_tilem/)
